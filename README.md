### Hi there :wave:

My name is Max and I'm a back-end engineer based in Hamburg, Germany.

#### What I do

I currently support [FREE NOW](https://free-now.com/) in their pivot from a pure taxi app to a multimodal mobility platform. People call this industry '[urban mobility](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/urban/urban_mobility_en)'.

Previously, I've dedicated a good chunk of my professional life working in financial technology.

I also did some security including penetration testing.

#### What I enjoy

Being alive and healthy.

#### What I value

Simplicity.

#### What I'm trying to eschew

Meetings.
