## Impact

* Designed distributed platforms processing **millions of daily events across production services**
* Increased deployment frequency **from monthly releases to daily delivery**
* Reduced cloud spend through architecture redesign and workload optimization
* Introduced organization-wide **observability and reliability practices**
* Turned ambiguous product initiatives into shipped, maintainable systems

---

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of **engineering execution, architecture, and business outcomes**.

* Architect distributed backend and data platforms
* Translate product ambiguity into pragmatic technical direction
* Build reliable cloud infrastructure and internal platforms
* Reduce operational risk through automation and observability
* Coach engineers toward senior and staff-level impact

I optimize for **long-term delivery speed**, not short-term heroics.
